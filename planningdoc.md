# Footer
Shows the org name, current date and time, your name and your role, back to top button

# Disk
## Overview
The disk will store and share all the files related to the events and organization. It has three permission levels. Crew, Event and Organization. This way they can isolate the respective files from other systems in case of privacy or because of organisation internally. (ref: google disk)

## Organization
The root folder of each disk is directly linked to the organization and is where all the org info is stored trough sheets, docs and other files. They can make sub folders here.

## Events
On organization creation a folder named events is auto generated. In here all the events and their respective files and data will be stored. The event folders are also generated during event onboarding / creation and is automatically set to event based viewing, meaning only the crew that are linked to the event can access it. However all crew will have read / write access to it if they are linked to the respective crew of the file or the file is set as global (all crews in an event).

# Messages
## Overview
A standard chat like view simular to instagram dms, with contacts and possibly groups. Could Also integrate directly to crews like a team or server (ref: discord, slack). Has a sidebar with all the contacts and a searchbar aswell as a "Messages" title. Pinned at the top is the "Organization" broadcaster, which is where all the global info from the organization is sent. Catering where all information from the catering crew is sent (not the same as the catering page.)

## Meetings
Voice and video calls with note taker. Log these in the chat. (ref: discord, slack, teams)

# Catering
Shows information sent by eighter the catering crew or catering company (compaies will still get a specific account in showtime linked to the organization that is created along with the organization / event, but not perzonalized).

This information would be trough eighter a site onboarding (for tours) or a event onboarding (for festivals, concerts or local gigs) and will include the day by day menu, opening times, allergy references, capacity, and other critical information. Messages can be sent out trough the chat or trough a page announcer (banner like announcement)

## Catering Capacity
To keep track of the capacity of the catering, each crew member will scan in and out when they are eating. This way, the entire event crew can ensure that they dont all eat at the same time, so the queues are not extremely long and there is space for everyone to sit and rest.

This will also make it possible for catering companies to put daily restrictions on the amount of times a single crew member can use the catering if required.

# Todo
## Organization
Basic kanban board linked to internal tasks by the organization, not associated with the events.

## Events
Basic kanban board specific to the event and auto filtered by crew and global tags. (Can be changed)

When events are created, notify the crew associated with the task. Each crew leader should be able to deligate tasks which will move them towards the top and change the background color or have an icon. Crew will be able to disable the delegation view and see the tasks based on completion time if desired.

# Map
